This Project is a command line application that evaluates mathematical expressions provided as input. The application should handle both integer and double values, supporting basic arithmetic operations as well as standard mathematical functions like cos, acos, sin, asin, tan, atan, sqrt, and pow. Your solution should produce valid responses for well-formed expressions and appropriately reports any malformed expressions.writing in both c and Python language.

## How to run Python script
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

2. Run the script using python math_evaluator.py.

'''
   python math_evaluator.py
'''
## How To compile and Run C code 

1. Navigate to the location where you saved the math_evaluator.c file.
2. Compile the code using the following command 

''' 
gcc math_evaluator.c -o math_evaluator -lm

'''
3. Run the executable

'''
./math_evaluator
 
'''
## issue
this code always prompts the expression provided to be malformed.so If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
